					Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's most famous work chronicles the history of 
					the fictional town of Macondo through several generations of the 
					Buend&iacute;a family. When reading it for the first time, I found myself
					having some trouble keeping up with the characters; many of the 
					characters share similar names, and with that comes similar traits
					(a prominent theme of the novel), so it was hard to tell who was 
					doing what in the story.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					While conflating these characters is not the worst crime in reading
					<i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, keeping track of everyone can be 
					distracting. My idea was to create a visualization that gave an 
					overview of when characters appeared in the novel. As you can see in
					the picture, the characters are listed on the vertical axis, and 
					the progression of the book lies on the horizontal axis, and is 
					broken up into chapters. Each time a character is mentioned, it
					is indicated by putting a mark in the row of that character and 
					the column of when it appears in the book.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					I would expect this to show patterns of character activity, like
					when that person lived, or when they were remembered after their 
					death, and how characters were related to one another. For example,
					Ursula, the matriarch of the family, is alive throughout most of 
					the novel, and the visualization would express this as she would
					have marks all along the horizontal dimension. Furthermore, each 
					character would have their own unique color, and if one scrolled
					over an event that related to multiple characters, those instances
					would be highlighted.
