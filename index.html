          I'm an analyst at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.

          I really love web development. My journey started out making data visualizations, but now I'm involved in all sorts of front-end
          open source software &mdash; Vue, (P)React, d3, babel, build tools, and more. It's such a wonderful community.

          Learning is important to me. I'm self-taught in a lot of things, so I know how hard it is to get started. To help others,
          I write. Whenever I learned something new or challenging, I try to write about it. Sometimes it's about code, but
          I also like to write about film and math.
        </p>

        <p>
          Code, film, and math are some of my favorite things, but I do other things too. Sometimes I perform stand-up comedy, I read
          lots of fiction, and I play Frisbee, tennis, the guitar, and the ukulele.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently working towards my Master's in Applied Math. I went to Swarthmore College for undergrad, where I studied Math,
          Film, and Economics.

          I know my website isn't fancy. I promise my other work is.
